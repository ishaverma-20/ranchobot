How Mastercard Payment Gateway Services work

How It Works (Transaction Flow)
What is the transaction flow for MPGS?
MPGS processes transactions through a secure, multi-step flow designed for efficiency and security.
1) Payment Authorization: When a customer initiates a payment, MPGS securely captures the payment details, whether from a card, digital wallet, or another payment method.
2) Data Encryption and Tokenization: To protect sensitive information, MPGS immediately encrypts the data and uses tokenization. Tokenization replaces the actual card number with a unique, non-sensitive token, meaning the merchant never stores raw card data.
3) Transaction Routing: The secured transaction data is routed to the appropriate acquiring bank from a network of nearly 200 global options.
4) Fraud Prevention: During the process, MPGS applies advanced fraud detection tools, such as EMV 3D Secure authentication and real-time risk analysis, to prevent fraudulent transactions.
5) Payment Settlement & Reporting: After successful authorization, the transaction is settled. MPGS provides merchants with detailed reporting and analytics tools to track performance and manage their finances.

Security and Data Protection Features in MPGS
How does MPGS ensure payment security?
MPGS uses a multi-layered security approach to protect merchants and customers, built on industry-leading standards.
1) PCI DSS Compliance: The gateway is fully compliant with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS), reducing the merchant's compliance burden.
2) Encryption and Tokenization: All sensitive data is encrypted in transit. Tokenization is used to replace real card numbers with unique, valueless tokens, so raw card data is never stored by the merchant.
3) EMV 3D Secure Authentication: This feature provides Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) by requiring an additional verification step (like an OTP) from the customer, which significantly reduces the risk of fraudulent transactions.
4) AI-Powered Fraud Detection: MPGS utilizes advanced, AI-driven tools for real-time transaction monitoring and risk analysis to identify and block potential fraud before it can cause damage.

Integration Method: White-Label Software
What is a white-label integration for MPGS?
A white-label integration is an alternative approach where a business uses a third-party payment software platform (that has MPGS pre-integrated) and presents it under its own brand.
Advantages of White-Label Integration:
1) Faster Deployment: Avoids the time and complexity of direct API development.
2) Reduced Compliance Burden: The white-label provider typically handles PCI DSS certification and security maintenance.
3) Multi-Acquirer Support: Can provide access to MPGS alongside hundreds of other payment methods and acquirers through a single connection.
4) Custom Branding: Offers a seamless, branded payment experience for customers without backend development.
5) Value-Added Features: Often includes advanced features like automated reconciliation, sophisticated routing, and chargeback management tools.
