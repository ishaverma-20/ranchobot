Security and Fraud Prevention Features
How does Mastercard PGS handle security and fraud?
1) Mastercard PGS prioritizes security with a multi-layered framework designed to protect both merchants and their customers.
2) PCI DSS Compliance: The gateway is fully PCI DSS compliant, which significantly reduces a merchant's burden for handling sensitive card data.
3) Tokenization: Replaces sensitive card numbers with a non-sensitive, unique identifier called a token. This means real card data is never stored on the merchant's system, minimizing risk.
4) EMV 3D Secure (3DS): Supports Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) through protocols like 3D Secure. This adds an extra layer of verification (like an OTP) for card payments, reducing fraud and shifting liability for fraudulent chargebacks away from the merchant.
5) AI-Powered Fraud Screening: Utilizes advanced tools and customizable risk rules to analyze transactions in real-time, identifying and blocking potentially fraudulent activity before it occurs.

What are the Integration Options provided by Mastercard PGS?
Integration Options provided by Mastercard PGS
1) Hosted Checkout
What is Mastercard PGS Hosted Checkout?
Hosted Checkout is the simplest and fastest way to integrate with Mastercard PGS. It is a secure, ready-to-use payment page that is hosted by Mastercard.
How it Works: When a customer is ready to pay, they are redirected from the merchant's website to the Mastercard PGS-hosted page to enter their payment details. After the transaction, they are sent back to the merchant's site.
Key Benefit: The merchant never handles or stores sensitive card data directly, which dramatically simplifies PCI DSS compliance.
Best For: Businesses looking for a quick, secure, and low-effort integration. It is customizable with branding and supports multiple payment methods and languages.
2) Direct API
What is Mastercard PGS Direct API Integration?
Direct API integration provides merchants with complete control and customization over the checkout experience.
How it Works: The merchant builds their own payment form on their website or app. They collect the customer's payment details and submit them securely to Mastercard PGS via backend API calls.
Key Benefit: Allows for a fully seamless user experience, as the customer never leaves the merchant's site. It offers maximum flexibility in design and flow.
Best For: Businesses with strong development resources who require a fully branded and customized checkout flow. This method requires the merchant to adhere to strict PCI DSS compliance standards.

Network Tokenization Explained
What is Network Tokenization in Mastercard PGS?
Network tokenization is an advanced security feature where sensitive card information is replaced with a unique, non-sensitive identifier called a "network token." This token is issued and managed by the card network itself (e.g., Mastercard, Visa).
Key Benefits of Network Tokenization:
1) Increased Security: The real card number is never exposed, reducing the risk of data breaches.
2) Improved Authorization Rates: Transactions using network tokens are often seen as more trusted by issuing banks, leading to fewer declines.
3) Automatic Card Updates: The key advantage. When a customer's physical card expires or is replaced, the network token is automatically updated by the card network. This ensures recurring billing and subscriptions continue without interruption.
4) Reduced PCI Scope: Simplifies PCI compliance for the merchant as they are not storing the primary account number (PAN).
